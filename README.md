# Stock-Price-Prediction

This project utilizes Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm, to predict stock prices. For data with timeframes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) come in handy but recent researches have shown that LSTM, networks are the most popular and useful variants of RNNs.

I have used Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal parameters for the model.

#Problem Highlights
The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future closing value of a given stock across a given period of time in the future. For this project I have used a Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices

#Achievements:
Built a model to accurately predict the future closing price of a given stock, using Long Short Term Memory Neural net algorithm.
Achieved Mean Squared Error rating of just 0.00093063.

Things i have learnt by completing this project:
